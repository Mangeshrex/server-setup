### Configuration Helpline

The configuration settings for the service are structured across multiple files, ensuring that each component runs with the appropriate settings. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

1. **Environment Configuration (`.env`)**:
   The data in the `config.json` closely reflects the rough structure of the `.env` file.

2. **Docker Compose Override (`docker-compose-override.yml`)**:
   This file is used to customize the default `docker-compose.yml` configurations.

3. **Service Configuration (`librechat.yaml`)**:
   This file contains specific configurations tailored for the Echo setup.
